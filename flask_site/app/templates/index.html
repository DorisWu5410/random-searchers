                        <p class="lead">With the use of a data set from NKI, our team worked together on a product that helps estimate the survival rate of a breast-cancer patient. This is done with the help of models such as SVM's and random forest classification. In addition, our product also recommends treatment plans based on those factors. <br> <br> Our mission is to assist breast cancer patients by offering a clear, accessible, and simple-to-understand website that examines data provided by the user to estimate survivability rates and displays common treatment options. Our product can potentially make it possible for doctors and patients to individually customize screening and preventative programs, decreasing the likelihood of a late diagnosis. </p>

Histtype stands for <a href = "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/histologic-grade">histological type</a>, which is a description of a tumor based on how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue look under a microscope as well as how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread. With this, histological type can also be a helpful thing to take into account when deciding what treatment plan would be the most effective.

                      <p class="lead">Linear Regression is a system to predict and model the relationship between multiple variables. In our data set, we used linear regression to predict the relationship between survival and time recurrence. Using this, the mean average value (MAE) was calculated to find the average value of these data points and analyze the variability of data. Our MAE was about 8.5559. </p>

                      <p class="lead"> Here we have a confusion matrix which is a type of support vector machine. A confusion matrix is a table that is used to define and display the performance of a classification algorithm. For this matrix, the x-values were age and time recurrence, and the target variable, which is the variable we were trying to predict, was survival rate. Overall, this matrix shows that after training the algorithm it was able to have an accuracy of 80% because out of the 55 values given, it was able to predict 44 correctly.

                      <p class="lead">A Random Forest based model achieves maximum performance on the training data set when evaluated using tenfold cross validation for the complete gene expression.
This classifier structures the data into numerous trees and obtains a final result i.e., whether a person is at risk of having recurrence of breast cancer or not. This may aid clinicians in identifying high risk patients, making treatment decisions and can potentially improve individual outcomes.</p>

This website and A.I. was built by Kelsey Stallard, Keimya Pennington, Esteban Grisalez, Sarah Son, and Mohammed Abdullah, with the help of our teacher Doris Wu. We had almost no experience with coding or web design, but we were able to learn and develop the skills necessary to create this website and do what we can to help patients with breast cancer.</p>
