{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0d3b8e","input":"<h1>Allow Users to Log Goals and Test (Your First Discord Bot Message)</h1>\nThis is also an asynchronous function, but in contrast with the previous function, this is under the @bot.command decorator. This means that if a user executes a specific command (remember, \"$\" followed by the specific command), the bot will execute this. Under the parenthesis of the decorator, the name attribute defines the command needed to execute the function. What this function does is checks if a new user enters a new goal after the $goal command. The arg property is the goal that the new user inputs. The arg property is initially set to none, and when the user inputs a message the arg property will be set to that message automatically. The conditional determines whether the arg property is None, and therefore determines whether the user sent anything. If the user has entered something, the bot sends a message using the ctx.send() method, and in parenthesis a formatted string that includes “goal logged” @ the author’s name. \n\n\n<h3>How to @ A user</h3>\nTo @ a user, you must use the format <@userid> in the quotes. The user id is ctx.message.author.id.\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\nThe function than logs the user’s name (ctx.message.author.name) as the key and the total ctx.message.author.id (the user id), the specific goal (arg), how many days the user has completed the goal (0 so far), and whether the user has completed the goal (so far False) as the value in the dictionary. Finally, notice how after the goal is logged in the dictionary, this is dumped as a json file. This is to store user data in case the server goes down.\n\n<h5>Now, test out the following function.

To find the id of the channel, change discord to developer mode (tutorial:https://techswift.org/2020/09/17/how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-discord/), right click on the channel you want to use, and copy the id of the channel, as you need the id to send a message on that channel. \n\nHere, the **user dict is also defined**, which is where we will be storing all the user identities and whether they completed their goals. The Bot class is initialized using the variable *“bot,”* with the attribute *“command_prefix”* set to *“$”*. The character you set the command_prefix to will indicate which special character you need to start a bot command with in order to run a command.

Use a .env file to store your secret token, and access it using the *python-dotenv* library.

Now, if a user ever enters the command $completed during the day, then the bot will first send the user a private message through the method “ctx.message.author.send” then @ the user with the message “completion logged.” The bot accesses the user dictionary and increases the days the user has logged days by one. Finally, the bot will change the value of whether the user completed the challenge to True. However, if the user has already logged completion (using the conditional), then the bot will send the user a message that tells the user they have already completed the daily goal. There is exception handling if the user is not in the database, and if not the bot sends the user a message to log a goal first. \n\n<h5>Now, run the following function and see if the discord bot responds with \"completion logged\" when you send the command \\$completed!</h5>","metadata":{"id":"WeM7dBeQW3Mi"},"pos":9,"type":"cell"}

This first function essentially sends direct messages to the users asking them if they have completed their specific goal. It iterates over the dictionary and sends a private message to each user. The second function is used to sync the first function, and waits to start the loop of the first function until a certain time is hit. It needs to wait every second to make sure the time is right, so use the asyncio.sleep function with the number of seconds waited as a parameter.\n\n<h5>Now, test the function to see how the discord bot send reminders!
