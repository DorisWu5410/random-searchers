{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0af867","input":"In this section, we will talk about for loops and while loops. In general, for loops are better for running a block of code a set number of times and while loops are better for running a block of code until some condition changes or is met. We'll start off by looking at for loops.","pos":20,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3afdac","input":"Unlike with for loops, in while loops it is important where in the loop the code is. For example, in the loop below we will swap the print line and the \"i = i + 1\" line and see what that does to the output.","pos":32,"type":"cell"}

Next we need to pick a random number between 1 and the user selected number.","pos":40,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7a14b6","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9ba395","input":"To generate a random integer between two specified numbers, all we need to do is use the \"randint\" function as seen below.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f4e2cb","input":"While the code still runs 5 times, the output has changed. It now includes 5!
